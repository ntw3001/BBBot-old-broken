    "2: Sweltering heat
    It's so hot and humid that some players collapse from heat exhaustion. Roll a D6 for each player on the pitch at the end of a drive. On a roll of 1 the player collapses and may not be set up for the next kick-off.
    3: Very sunny
    A glorious day, but the blinding sunshine causes a -1 modifier on all passing rolls.
    4-10: Perfect Conditions
    Neither too cold nor too hot. A warm, dry and slightly overcast day provides perfect conditions to Blood Bowl.
    11: Pouring rain
    It's raining, making the ball slippery and difficult to hold. A -1 modifier applies to all catch, intercept, or pick-up rolls.
    12: Blizzard
    It's cold and snowing! The ice on the pitch means that any player attempting to move an extra square (GFI) will slip and be Knocked Down on a roll of 1-2, while the snow means that only quick or short passes can be attempted."
  elsif a_question.match?("spring")
    "2: Morning Dew
    The pitch is dew-covered from the cold of night, making everything a little slippery. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player attempts to Rush an extra square. Additionally, apply a -1 modifier every time a player makes an Agility test to pick up the ball.
    3: Blossoming Flowers
    The flowers are blooming, the tree sap is pumping and the pollen count is high, forcing the hay fever-afflicted referee to seek shelter indoors. Whilst this weather condition is in effect, players cannot be Sent-off for committing a Foul, even if they roll a natural double on either the Armour roll or the Injury roll.
    4-10: Perfect Conditions
    It's not quite warm but then again, it's not quite cold - ideal weather for a game of Blood Bowl!
    11: Misty Morning
    A haze of thick mist has descended upon the pitch, greatly reducing visibility. Players can move only a maximum of six squares, although they may still Rush as normal. Additionally, only Quick and Short pass actions can be performed
    12: High Winds
    The winds are whistling through the stadium and the players can barely hear each other. Roll a D6 each time a player on your team wishes to use a team re-roll. On a roll of 2+, you may use a team re-roll as normal. On a 1, a team re-roll cannot be used."

    "2: Sweltering Heat
    Some players faint in the unbearable heat! D3 randomly selected players from each team that are on the pitch when a drive ends are placed in the Reserves box. They must miss the next drive.
    3: Melting Astrogranite
    It's not just the players that are affected by the hot weather - even the pitch is melting! It might be the heat, or it might be the sticky footing, but the players are certainly struggling to move! The number of squares a player can attempt to Rush is reduced by one (to a minimum of one).
    4-10: Perfect Conditions
    It's still hot, but not as hot as it has been lately! A (tolerably) warm, dry and slightly overcast day provides perfect conditions for Blood Bowl.
    11: Blinding Rays
    No cloud cover in the clear, blue skies and the relentless glare of the sun leaves the players squinting and shading their eyes. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player tests against their Passing Ability. Additionally, only Quick and Short pass actions can be performed.
    12: Monsoon
    A sudden burst of torrential rain and high winds hits the pitch, making the ball slippery and erratic. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player makes an Agility test to catch or pick up the ball, or to attempt to interfere with a pass. Additionally, when the ball scatters, it moves from the square in which it was placed four times before landing, rather than the usual three."

    "2: Leaf-strewn Pitch
    Huge drifts of leaves have piled up at regular intervals across the pitch. It looks terrible, but they're soft to land on! When a player Falls Over or is Knocked Down, the coach of the opposing team must apply a -1 modifier when making an Armour roll against them.
    3: Autumnal Chill
    Winter is fast approaching and players are reluctant to leave the comfortable warmth of the dugout. During the End of Drive sequence, apply a -1 modifier when rolling to see if a player recovers from being KO'd.
    4-10: Perfect Conditions
    It's not quite warm, but then again it's not quite cold - ideal Blood Bowl weather! A pleasant autumn afternoon provides perfect conditions for Blood Bowl.
    11: Pouring Rain
    A torrential downpour leaves the players soaked and the ball very slippery! Apply a -1 modifier every time a player makes an Agility test to catch or pick up the ball, or to attempt to interfere with a pass.
    12: Strong Winds
    If it wasn't for the winds, it would be a lovely day. The ball does not deviate normally. Instead, after placing the kick, the coach of the kicking team rolls a D8 to determine the direction in which the wind is blowing: D8 - WIND DIRECTION 1-2 Towards the kicking team's End Zone. 3-4 Towards the receiving team's End Zone. 5-6 Towards the Sideline to the left of the kicking team. 7-8 Towards the Sideline to the right of the kicking team. Next, place the Throw-in template over the square in which the kick was placed, with the central arrow (3-4) pointing in the direction in which the wind is blowing. The kick then deviates in a direction determined by rolling a D6 and referring to the Throw-in template. Additionally, the number of squares the ball moves is determined by rolling a D8, rather than a D6."

    "2: Cold Winds
    The fans are shivering in the stands as a viciously cold wind blows steadily down the pitch. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player tests against their Passing Ability. Players also find it harder to get motivated and get back on the pitch. Additionally, during Step 2 of the End of Drive sequence, apply a -1 modifier when rolling to see if any player in the Knockedout box recovers.
    3: Freezing
    A sudden cold snap turns the ground as hard as granite (and not the 'astro' variety that players are used to). When a player Falls Over or is Knocked Down, the coach of the opposing team must apply a +1 modifier when making an Armour roll against them.
    4-10: Perfect Conditions
    It's rather chilly and it's threatening to rain (or snow), but considering the time of year, the conditions are almost perfect for Blood Bowl.
    11: Heavy Snow
    Freezing conditions and heavy falls of snow make the footing treacherous. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player attempts to Rush an extra square. Additionally, the poor visibility means that only Quick and Short passes can be attempted.
    12: Blizzard
    Freezing conditions and heavy falls of snow make the footing treacherous. Apply a -1 modifier every time a player attempts to Rush an extra square. Additionally, the poor visibility means that only Quick and Short passes can be attempted."
